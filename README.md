A **Java-based mobile phone virus simulation** using **Swing and Multithreading**. Phones move randomly on the screen and an infection spreads when an infected phone gets close to a healthy phone. The repair shop helps infected phones recover.

This was a **2nd-year university project** I made, focusing on **DSA tecnhniques**.

## 📌 Features
- Phones **move randomly** on the screen.
- **Infection spreads** if a healthy phone is near an infected phone (note proximity is base on black dot and is a very near distance for infection).
- A **repair shop** heals infected phones.
- **Multithreaded simulation** to handle phone movement independently.
- **Synchronization techniques** to prevent race conditions.

## 📱 Usage

- **Controls:**
  - ⬆️  → Add a new phone.
  - V → Infect a random phone.
